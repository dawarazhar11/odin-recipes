Web Development Journey - HTML Basics - Recipe Project

In this project, I started learning the HTML5 basics. The basic knowledge that I acquired is about DOCTYPE (HTML5), metadata, head and body tag, usage of links and images. Critical aspect is attributing using hypertext references (href). In order to have links open in a new tab the target attribute with blank parameter is used, and I think this is really useful feature. noreferrer relation is also important to provide basic security to the links being opened from our home page.

Recipe project made use of the above learnings and ordered/un-ordered lists with two level headings (h1 and h2).

A really good start!
